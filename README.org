* Introduction
This is similar to Anki or Mnemosyne.
Advantages are you stay in emacs.
Entries are text so we can have decks as files, so we have decks in versioncontrol, which i think is a very good thing, because it makes sharing and collaborating on decks easy.

* Setup
  - Add learn keyword to your todo-keywords e.g.
    (setq org-todo-keywords     
        '((sequence "TODO" "LEARN" "|" "DONE")))
  -  (setq org-agenda-files (list ((concat org-directory "refile.lrn"))))
See also config.el.example for setup for using org-cature with org-lrn.
    
* Functions
org-lrn-entries: Learn all scheduled entries
org-lrn-file: Learn all scheduled entries in file
org-lrn-entry: Init entry at point (add properties and schedules).
org-lrn-init-file: Init all entries in a file. 

* TODO Future
A webfrontend would be useful for some media heavy stuff (pictures, videos) and could be made using elnode.
